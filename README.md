**Documentation for Iris Flower Classification Notebook:**

**1. Data Loading and Exploration:**

- Load the Iris dataset from sklearn.
- Convert the data to a Pandas DataFrame.
- Print the first few rows of the DataFrame.
- Print descriptive statistics of the data.
- Check for missing values.
- Visualize the distribution of each feature using histograms.
- Visualize the relationships between features using a pairplot.

**2. Model Training and Explanation:**

- Split the data into features (X) and target labels (y).
- Train a Random Forest classifier on the data.
- Use LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain the predictions of the model for a single instance.
- Display the explanation in the notebook.


**Conclusion:**

This notebook demonstrates how to use LIME to explain the predictions of a Random Forest classifier for the Iris flower dataset. The provided documentation explains each step of the process, making it easy for others to understand and reproduce the results.
